# 🦓 FXR90 Embedded C++ SDK Regression Suite 🔬

📝 Overview
Welcome! This repository hosts a comprehensive regression and manual test suite for the FXR90 Embedded RFID SDK. The primary goal is to validate the functionality, robustness, and performance of the RFID reader APIs. Our tests cover everything from region support and tag access operations to critical event handling.

🚀 Key Features:
🌍 Region Configuration & Validation: Ensures region-specific settings are configured and compliant.
🏷️ Tag Access Operations: Extensive test coverage for read, write, lock, block erase, and other custom access operations.
📡 Event Handling: Validates RFID events such as ACCESS_START_EVENT, ACCESS_STOP_EVENT, inventory cycles, GPI triggers, and more.
⏱️ Performance & Stress Testing: Includes dedicated stress tests and performance counters to benchmark access operations.

🛠️ Building the Project
Prerequisites
-A Linux 64-bit environment
-GNU Make
-A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang)

Build Commands
First, navigate to the project directory:
cd /home/symbol/embedded_sdk_rfid/fxr90/New_testing_Backup
Then, use the following commands to build the different test suites:
-- Build regression tests (clean and debug)
make -f makeRegression linux64_clean
make -f makeRegression linux64_debug

-- Build manual tests (clean and debug)
make -f makeManual linux64_clean
make -f makeManual linux64_debug

Your compiled binaries (ELF files) will be located in the linux64_clean and linux64_debug directories.

🏃‍♂️ Running Tests
1. After a successful build, copy the desired ELF file to your RFID Reader.
2. Create a config.txt file in the same directory on the reader with the following content:
APIVersion: RFID_API3_5_5
readerIP: 169.254.10.1
readertype: FX
antennaList: 6
antSeq: 1 2 3 4 5 6
SecureMode: 0
3. Execute the test binary. For troubleshooting, please refer to the logs generated by each test case
   
⚙️ A Closer Look at Access Operations
This suite provides deep coverage of RFID tag access operations.

|   Feature               | Description                                                                                                         |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Read/Write Access**   | Utilizes structures like `READ_ACCESS_PARAMS` and `WRITE_ACCESS_PARAMS` for core operations.                        |
| **Access Sequences**    | Batch multiple operations using APIs like `RFID_InitializeAccessSequence` and `RFID_PerformAccessSequence`.         |
| **Event Handling**      | Employs semaphores and callbacks for `ACCESS_START_EVENT` and `ACCESS_STOP_EVENT` to ensure proper synchronization. |
| **Security**            | Includes tests for password management, lock/unlock operations, and authentication (G2V2, ImpinjQT, NXP).           |
| **Performance Metrics** | Tracks success/fail counts and logs detailed results for benchmarking.                                              |

Example Access Flow:
1. Initialize the Access Sequence.
2. Add Read, Write, or Lock operations to the sequence.
3. Perform the Access Sequence.
4. Handle events and log the results.
5. Stop & Deinitialize the sequence.

📌 Additional Notes
The BuildResults/ directory is ignored by Git, so only source code and configuration files are tracked.
To add support for new regions or modes, modify the relevant makefile and source files.
Utility functions for handling access status and operation codes are available in utils.h.
